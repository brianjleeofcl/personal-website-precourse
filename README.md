#### Scope and Content

Your personal website should have two pages linked together with anchor tags.

On the first page, describe who you are and where you come from. Tell us about yourself, your hobbies, hometown, family, friends, etc. For example:

> Hi there! My name is Zelda. I was born into royalty and spend my nights and weekends battling evil. My closest friend is Link. Together, we protect the kingdom of Hyrule. Here's a picture of us fighting Ganon. [INSERT PHOTO]

On the second page, describe where you're going in life and who you'll become. Tell us about your career goals, education goals, hopes, dreams, etc. For example:

> I'm excited to start Galvanize and learn about web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enrolled in the web development immersive because I've always been fascinated by the web's ability to bring people together. After Galvanize, I would love to work for a social network company like Snapchat or OKCupid.

Oh, and somewhere on your website, include an animated GIF that illustrates how you feel about starting your new career. For example:

#### Structure and Style

You're free to structure and style your website in any way you please. Though it may feel intimidating, this is your chance to show us who you are.

When it comes to structure, it's a good idea to use semantic tags for your content. In other words,

- If you have content that's a primary heading, use an `<h1>` tag.
- If you have content that's a secondary heading, use an `<h2>` tag.
- If you have content that's an ordered list, use an `<ol>` tag.
- If you have content that's an unordered list, use an `<ul>` tag.
- If you have content that's tabular, use a `<table>` tag.
- If you have content that's belongs in the same section, use a `<section>` tag.
- If you have content that's belongs in the same navigation, use a `<nav>` tag.
- And so on.

When it comes to style, take this opportunity to present your personality to us visually. In other words,

- Capture our attention with typographic properties like `font`, `line-height`, and `text-align`.
- Arrange your content with layout properties like `display`, `position`, `left`, `top`, `float`, and `clear`.
- Size your content with dimensional properties like `height`, `width`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin`.
- Spice up to your content with coloration properties like `color`, `background-color`, and `background-image`.
- And so on.

You're free to get as fancy as you want, but don't feel like you have to go overboard. You're also free to add interactivity with JavaScript, but it's not a requirement for this assessment. As you work, keep an eye on how much time has elapsed. There are a few more chapters in this precourse, like one dedicated to JavaScript, that are equally important.

#### Valid Syntax

To help you write correct code, we recommend you use a **syntax validator**â€”a tool that'll list out all the syntax warnings and errors in your code. It's okay if your code has syntax warnings, but you'll want to fix any syntax errors before you submit your website. The syntax validators check one file at a time, so remember to validate each HTML and CSS file.

- [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload)
